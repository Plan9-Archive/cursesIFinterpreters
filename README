There are ports to plan 9 of interactive fiction interpreters which
make use of a ported curses library.  This enables some games to be
played which don't work right with frotz-dumb or cheapglk.

The "buildall" script compiles and installs the necessary curses
library and interpreters under the names cfrotz, cglulxe, and chugo.
Precompiled binaries for x86 are availables at:
