There are ports to plan 9 of interactive fiction interpreters which
make use of a ported curses library.  This enables some games to be
played which don't work right with frotz-dumb or cheapglk.

As of the time of this upload (9/29/2015), building these successfully
in 9front also requires latest updates to fix bugs in cmd/cpp and
ape's libdraw.  binaries are availables at
files.9gridchan.org/fictools
